## Hi there 👋
<!--I am an accountant with 8 years of experience who recently decided to switch to the IT industry. 
Software testing is a field that has intrigued me greatly. I am particularly fascinated by the possibilities of automation. 
In my repository, you will mainly find tasks that I tackled during the software testing course at GOIT.
