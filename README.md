## About me üë©‚Äçüíª    

I am a QA Engineer with 8 years of experience in accounting, now fully focused on the IT industry. Software testing, especially automation, has become my primary area of interest.

Currently, I volunteer as a QA tester at the Norwegian startup Pletly, where I am responsible for both manual and automated testing of web and mobile applications that facilitate communication between parents of individuals with disabilities and social care workers. My work includes identifying bugs, enhancing user experience, and ensuring high software quality.

In addition to manual testing, I am learning to write automated tests using Cypress in TypeScript, further expanding my skills in test automation.

I am also passionate about AI-based applications, particularly for language learning, drawing on my background in English Philology. My dream is to contribute to the development of such innovative solutions!
