## About me üë©‚Äçüíª    
I am an accountant with 8 years of experience who decided to switch to the IT industry.   
Software testing is a field that has intrigued me the most. I am especially fascinated by the possibilities of automation.   
My professional experience will be particularly valuable in testing accounting software or payment applications.   
Moreover, I'm interested in AI-based applications, especially those for language learning due to my background in English Philology.  
My dream job is to work on developing such applications!
