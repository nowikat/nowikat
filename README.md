## Hi there ðŸ‘‹  
I am an accountant with 8 years of experience who recently decided to switch to the IT industry.   
Software testing is a field that has intrigued me the most. I am especially fascinated by the possibilities of automation.   
My professional experience will be particularly valuable in testing accounting software or payment applications.    


In most of my repositories you will find tasks that I tackled during the software testing course at GOIT!
